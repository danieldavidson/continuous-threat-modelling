# Continuous Threat Modelling

Continuous Threat Modelling (CTM) is a threat modelling approach that enables development teams to perform threat modelling autonomously with minimal initial security knowledge. The approach is evolutionary, dynamic and should mesh well with teams using Agile and evolving system architectures.

## Contributing

All manner of contributions are welcome. The approach is in early development and the focus is on creating a simple, effective, easy to use workflow.

* Changes are welcome via pull request.
* Use informative commit messages and pull request descriptions.
* Keep style consistent.
* Keep things simple.
* Focus on principles.

## Background

To learn how Autodesk uses their [CTM Handbook and Checklist](https://github.com/Autodesk/continuous-threat-modeling) for continuous threat modelling, watch ["Threat Modeling Every Story: Practical Continuous Threat Modeling For Your Team"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbW-X0j35gw).
